# Project Domain
Furniture shopping is a system that will allow user to buy and sell Furnitures products online. Furniture products will be displayed in user-friendly and attractive Graphical User Interface (GUI). There will be variety of Furnitures products that we can choose from on this website. It will be like a shopping near your local Furnitures store except its online virtual store. User will have to first make their account on the website and after making the account they can login to the website and view the furniture available. If they want to buy the furniture, they can view the furniture details and add them to their cart. The selected cart will contain user’s name, contact details, product and its amount the user had selected. All the data of the users, furniture, and orders details are stored on the server side in a web service. User can browse the website for the Furnitures such as tables,chairs,sofa and other household products. Waiting on long queue and checking you have enough money for the furniture are struggle. So, ordering online by sitting at home and purchasing the product by knowing the details and price of the furniture’ product will be very easy task to do. The furniture products will be convenient and faster to get. It saves the transportation cost and time to travel to the store and get back home. Using the website can make the vendor very efficient on selling their things. Marketing will be very easy and effective for the product’s vendor. This system will be able to properly buy/sell items online so that people can save a lot of time and energy.

# Scope of the project
The system can be used by any furniture shop from small to big. The system will be accessible from mobile devices to the computers so people can always stay in touch with the website from anywhere and anytime. The system will allow user to buy and sell furniture products from the website. It can help reach vendor wider markets by covering disadvantage of the existing system. The main scope of the project is to make user friendly website and maximize the benefits of an e-commerce website. Using the website will remove old the manual operation to record all the information.
